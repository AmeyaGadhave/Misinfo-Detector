# Misinfo-Detector
AI-Powered Misinformation Detector analyzes any news article using LLMs, evidence extraction, stance detection, knowledge graphs, and a credibility scoring engine. It provides summaries, key evidence, bias insights, and interactive visualizations through a modern research dashboard. This project uses an advanced hybrid AI pipeline that combines LLM-powered reasoning (OpenAI GPT-4o) with traditional NLP techniques to detect misinformation in news articles. It integrates intelligent agents for multilingual summarization, stance detection, contradiction analysis, and bias identification. Evidence extraction uses Transformer-based semantic similarity models (Sentence-BERT), while relationship extraction with spaCy and NetworkX constructs a dynamic knowledge graph. A custom credibility engine evaluates articles using LLM-verified facts, stance polarity, evidence consistency, and graph density. Together, these components form a powerful research-grade system that analyzes any URL, extracts structured insights, and presents them in a clean, interactive dashboard for researchers, journalists, and analysts.
